## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability
- **Description**: The target was found to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which can allow attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or even complete system compromise.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Implement parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  - Conduct regular security testing and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## Moderate Vulnerabilities

### 2. Open Ports Detected
- **Description**: The Nmap scan revealed open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on the target.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Open ports can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks against the server.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Ensure that only necessary ports are open and monitored.
  - Implement a firewall to restrict access to open ports based on IP address and protocol.

## Low-Risk Issues

### 3. Discovered Directories
- **Description**: Multiple directories were discovered during the Gobuster scan, including `.well-known/security.txt`, which may expose sensitive information.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: While not immediately dangerous, the exposure of certain directories can provide attackers with information that may aid in further attacks.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Review and restrict access to sensitive directories.
  - Implement proper access controls and ensure that sensitive files are not publicly accessible.

### 4. HTTP Redirection
- **Description**: The target URL redirects to `http://www.google.com/`, which may not be necessary and could lead to confusion.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Unnecessary redirection can lead to user experience issues and may be exploited for phishing attacks.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Evaluate the necessity of the redirection and remove it if not required.
  - Ensure that all redirects are secure and lead to trusted destinations.
