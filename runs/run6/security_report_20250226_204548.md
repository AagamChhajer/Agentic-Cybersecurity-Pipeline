## Moderate-Risk Issues

### 2. Open Ports Detected
- **Description**: The Nmap scan revealed open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on example.com, which are standard for web services but may expose the server to various attacks if not properly secured.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `example.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Open ports can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks against the web application.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Ensure that only necessary services are running and that they are properly configured.
  - Implement a firewall to restrict access to open ports based on IP address and protocol.
  - Regularly review and monitor open ports and services.

## Low-Risk Issues

### 3. Discovered Directories
- **Description**: The Gobuster scan identified several directories, including `/Users`, `/wordlists`, and `/SecLists`, which may contain sensitive information or resources that could be exploited.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://example.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Exposure of sensitive directories can lead to information disclosure and may assist attackers in planning further attacks.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Restrict access to sensitive directories using proper permissions and authentication.
  - Remove or secure any unnecessary directories that do not need to be publicly accessible.
  - Implement directory listing prevention in the web server configuration.
