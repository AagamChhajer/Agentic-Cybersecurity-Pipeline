## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability
- **Description**: The target was found to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which can allow an attacker to manipulate database queries.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or even complete system compromise.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Implement parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  - Conduct regular security testing and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## Moderate Vulnerabilities

### 2. Open Ports
- **Description**: The Nmap scan revealed open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) on the target.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Open ports can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks against the server.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Ensure that only necessary ports are open and monitored.
  - Implement a firewall to restrict access to open ports.

### 3. Directory Enumeration
- **Description**: Multiple directories were discovered through Gobuster and FFUF scans, including sensitive paths.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: Exposure of sensitive directories can lead to information disclosure and potential exploitation.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Review and restrict access to sensitive directories.
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Low-Risk Issues

### 4. Discovered Endpoints
- **Description**: Various endpoints were discovered that may not be intended for public access.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com`
- **Potential Impact**: While not immediately exploitable, these endpoints could provide information useful for future attacks.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Regularly audit and review endpoints to ensure they are necessary and secure.
  - Implement security measures such as rate limiting and logging access attempts.

### 5. Security.txt File Exposure
- **Description**: The `.well-known/security.txt` file was accessible, which may contain contact information for security issues.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `http://google.com/.well-known/security.txt`
- **Potential Impact**: While this file is intended for public access, it could provide attackers with information on how to report vulnerabilities, potentially leading to social engineering attacks.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Ensure that the contents of the security.txt file are appropriate and do not disclose sensitive information.
  - Consider restricting access to sensitive information within the file.
