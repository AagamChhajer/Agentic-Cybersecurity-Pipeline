## Moderate Vulnerabilities

### 2. Open Ports
- **Description**: Several non-standard ports were found open during the scan, which may expose the system to unnecessary risks.
- **Affected Target(s)**: Web server (IP: [insert IP address])
- **Potential Impact**: Open ports can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks against the server.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Close any non-essential open ports.
  - Implement a firewall to restrict access to only necessary services.

### 3. Directory Listing Enabled
- **Description**: Directory listing was found enabled on certain directories, exposing file structures and potentially sensitive files.
- **Affected Target(s)**: `/uploads`, `/assets`
- **Potential Impact**: Attackers can enumerate files and directories, potentially leading to the discovery of sensitive information or files.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Disable directory listing in the web server configuration.
  - Regularly audit directory permissions and access controls.

## Low-Risk Issues

### 4. Outdated Software Components
- **Description**: Some software components used in the web application were found to be outdated, including libraries and frameworks.
- **Affected Target(s)**: Various components of the web application
- **Potential Impact**: Outdated software may contain known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Regularly update all software components to the latest stable versions.
  - Monitor for security advisories related to used libraries and frameworks.

### 5. Missing Security Headers
- **Description**: Several security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) were missing from HTTP responses.
- **Affected Target(s)**: All web application endpoints
- **Potential Impact**: The absence of security headers can increase the risk of attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.
- **Recommended Remediation Steps**:
  - Implement recommended security headers in the web server configuration.
  - Regularly review and update security policies.
